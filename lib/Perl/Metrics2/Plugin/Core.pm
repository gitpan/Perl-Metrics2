=head1 NAME

Perl::Metrics::Plugin::Core - The Core Perl Metrics Package

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a set of core metrics for Perl documents, based on
very simple code using only the core L<PPI> package.

=head1 METRICS

As with all L<Perl::Metrics::Plugin> packages, all metrics can be
referenced with the global identifier C<Perl::Metrics::Plugin::Core::metric>.

Metrics are listed as "datatype name".

}

=head2 integer bytes

The C<bytes> metric represents the number of bytes in the file.

=cut

sub metric_bytes {
	bytes::length($_[1]->serialize);
}

=pod

=head2 integer tokens 

The C<tokens> metric represents the total number of L<PPI::Token> objects
contained in the document.

For example, the following one-line document would have a C<tokens> metric
of 5 (assuming a single trailing newline)

  print "Hello World!\n";

=cut

sub metric_tokens {
	scalar $_[1]->tokens;
}

=pod

=head2 integer significant_tokens

The C<significant_tokens> metric represents the total number of
C<significant> tokens contained in the document.

This filters out things like whitespace and comments, and refers (more or
less) to only the parts of the document that actually do something.

For more information on significance, see L<PPI::Element/significant>.

=cut

sub metric_significant_tokens {
	scalar grep { $_->significant } $_[1]->tokens;
}
